Somewhere far away, under the same sky… I think of you.|
And in that moment, the world feels a little closer.
With every beat of my heart, I send my love across the horizon…
Distance means nothing 
when a heart knows where it belongs.
Did you feel it...? A gentle warmth brushing your soul?
That's me… arriving in your heart.
And now that you hold it… it's yours, forever.
From Bangladesh, with all my love… Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday Pratima , Happy Birthday to you

Dear Pratima, Even though it's been just 15 days, every message, every smile you share is precious.On your birthday, I wish I could be there — but till we meet, I made this little website for you.And today, I want to ask you something straight from my heart:I love You . Will you be mine? If your answer is yes, then just write I love you too" and send it to me."
Yours lovely,Ethun.
I knew you also love me.
